    Ahi poke bowl is a refreshing Hawaiian dish featuring chunks of fresh, sushi-grade Ahi tuna marinated in a savory blend of soy sauce,
    sesame oil, and rice vinegar. This flavorful base is paired with vibrant ingredients like creamy avocado, crisp cucumber slices,
    and delicate radishes, all served atop a bed of fluffy sushi rice or crisp greens. Garnished with sesame seeds and scallions,
    the bowl is elevated with a drizzle of spicy mayo or sriracha, adding a kick of heat.

    meal reminiscent of the tropical shores of Hawaii.
