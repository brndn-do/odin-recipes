    <h2>Description</h2>
    Kimchi fried rice is a savory Korean dish that combines cooked rice with kimchi, a spicy fermented cabbage.
    The dish typically includes ingredients like diced vegetables, such as onions and carrots, along with garlic,
    soy sauce, and often a protein like diced chicken or pork. The kimchi adds a tangy, slightly spicy flavor to the rice,
    while the stir-frying process caramelizes the ingredients, creating a satisfyingly aromatic and hearty meal. 
    It's often garnished with sliced green onions and sesame seeds for added texture and flavor.
