    <h2>Description</h2>
    A cheeseburger is a classic American indulgence that features a juicy beef patty nestled between toasted buns.
    The patty, seasoned to perfection and grilled to a mouthwatering char, is topped with melted cheddar cheese that oozes with each bite.
    Crisp lettuce and slices of ripe tomato add freshness and crunch, while a spread of tangy ketchup and creamy mayonnaise enhances the savory flavors.
    Pickles provide a zesty kick, balancing the richness of the cheese and beef.
    This iconic dish is not just a meal but a culinary delight that combines comforting textures and bold flavors,
    offering a taste of nostalgia with every satisfying bite.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>Ground beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>Hamburger buns</li>
        <li>Cheddar cheese slices</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>Tomato slices</li>
        <li>Pickles (sliced)</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>Mayonaise</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Ingredients: Begin by dividing the ground beef into equal portions and shaping them into patties. Season each patty generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Preheat the Grill or Pan: Heat a grill or large skillet over medium-high heat. Ensure the grill or skillet is well-oiled to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Cook the Patties: Place the seasoned patties onto the hot grill or skillet. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, adjusting for desired doneness from medium-rare to well-done.</li>
        <li>Toast the Buns: While the patties cook, lightly toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster until they are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Melt the Cheese: During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheddar cheese on each patty to melt slightly.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Cheeseburgers: Spread a layer of mayonnaise on the bottom half of each toasted bun. Add a lettuce leaf and tomato slices on top of the mayo.</li>
        <li>Add the Patty and Toppings: Place the cooked cheeseburger patty on top of the tomatoes. Add a few slices of pickles on top of the patty.</li>
        <li>Finish and Serve: Spread ketchup on the inside of the top half of the toasted bun. Place it on top of the pickles to complete the cheeseburger.</li>
        <li>Serve Immediately: Serve the cheeseburgers immediately while warm, accompanied by your favorite sides or fries.</li>
    </ol>
